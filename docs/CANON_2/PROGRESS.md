# Canon 2.0 — progress

Last update: 2026-11-03.

## Iteration 2 (this one)

**Builder 2.0 — editing model.**
- Typed operations in `@canon/blocks` (`edit.ts`): `NODE_INSERT/REMOVE/MOVE/REORDER/DUPLICATE/
  REPLACE`, `PROPS_UPDATE`, `NODE_META`, `STYLE_SET`, `NODE_GROUP/UNGROUP`. The builder applies
  every edit through them, logs them (History tab) and they are the vocabulary for Canon AI
  (Stage 5). Locked blocks and nesting rules are enforced inside the operations.
- The tree helpers moved from the admin into `@canon/blocks` and keep untouched subtrees by
  identity (structural sharing).
- Multi-select (Ctrl/Shift+click on canvas and in Layers), a multi-selection toolbar, Ctrl+A.
- Copy / cut / paste across pages (Ctrl+C/X/V), group / ungroup (Ctrl+G / Ctrl+Shift+G), a new
  Group block (stack, row or grid).
- Global components: create from any block, instances with per-page text/link overrides, detach,
  a component builder, draft vs published versions, a component list per site; delivery expands
  published components (API, RLS, audit, outbox invalidation).

**Stage 4 (first part) — section library.** 29 section layouts (hero, features, social proof,
pricing, CTA, FAQ, team, contact, content, header/footer) × 4 tones = 116 variants, built from the
regular blocks and styles, copy in English and Russian. Searchable palette.

**Performance.** Memoised style compilation (35 → 1.3 ms per edit at 3 000 blocks), memoised canvas
rendering, one stylesheet per section on the canvas. Browser measurements at 1 000 / 3 000 blocks
and lab metrics of published pages (PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md).

**Polish.** The whole builder in Russian (≈ 380 strings, including block names, fields and the
renderer's placeholders), theme colour chips in the site's colours, status badges translated.

**Fixes** found by the new tests: see TEST_REPORT.md (style input mangling, co-editing undo
merging operations, Ctrl+S during autosave, block cap, duplicate losing styles, silent group).

Tests: 331 automated (unit 173, API integration 141, E2E 17).

## Iteration 1

Stage 0 audit; Stage 1 design system (tokens, dark/light, toggle); Builder 2.0 foundation
(responsive style layer, Style panel, five breakpoints, real-width canvas, zoom, Layers actions).

## Not done yet (next)

1. Stage 5: AI planner that proposes typed operations, a diff view, approve/reject per operation.
2. Stage 4: more layouts (target 100+ distinct layouts, today 29 × 4 tones), block variants,
   section thumbnails in the palette.
3. Operation-based undo (today undo is still snapshot-based with structural sharing; the
   operation log is for history, audit and AI).
4. Lighthouse CI with mobile throttling; Yjs diff that skips unchanged subtrees; virtualised Layers.
5. Remaining admin screens in Russian (collections, settings, analytics…).

Stages 6–18 (CMS 2.0, e-commerce, CRM, SEO, themes, animation, analytics, hosting, security,
multilingual, developer platform, migration, local integrations) have not started. See ROADMAP.md.
